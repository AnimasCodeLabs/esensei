      <h3>What is an e-sensei?</h3>
      <p>An E-sensei is a virtual mentor who is a master in your field and will guide you as you embark on your path to becoming self-employed.</p>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>When you sign up for E-sensei, you are immediately connected to a vast network of industry leaders. All new members start out as “white-belts” and will learn the basic forms of freelance customer engagement. After the forms have been mastered, white belts will be tested for their skills and will have the opportunity to move up the ranks, with the ultimate goal of becoming an e-sensei within their dojo.</p>
